Open the file in append plus mode (**`'a+'`**)  \n2. Write a new line for Rio de Janeiro `\"\\nRio de Janeiro,Brazil,30.0,18.0\"`  \n\n\n#### Grab the column headings  \n1. Use .seek() to move the pointer to the beginning of the file  \n2. Read the first line of text into a variable called: `headings`     \n3. Convert `headings` to a list using **`.split(',')`** which splits on each comma  \n\n\n```python\n# [ ] The Weather: open file, read/print first line, convert line to list (splitting on comma)\n\n\n```\n\n#### Read the remaining lines from the file using a while loop\n  1. Assign remaining lines to a **`city_temp`** variable  \n  2. Convert the city_temp to a list using **`.split(',')`** for each **`.readline()`** in the loop  \n  3. Print each city & the highest monthly average temperature   \n  4. Close mean_temps\n\n>Tips & Hints:   \n- Print **`headings`** to determine indexes to use for the final output (what is in headings[0], [1], [2]..?)  \n- The city_temp data follows the order of the headings (city_temp[0] is described by headings[0]) \n- The output should look like: **`\"month ave: highest high\" for Beijing is 30.9 Celsius`**  \n- Convert `city_temp` to lists with `.split(',')`  \n\n\n```python\n# [ ] The Weather: use while loop to print city and highest monthly average temp in celsius\n\n\n```\n\n\n"
