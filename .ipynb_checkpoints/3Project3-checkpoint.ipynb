The program should use the various code syntax covered in Module 3.  \n>  \n>The program must result in print output using numeric input similar to that shown in the sample below.\n\n## Program: Cheese Order    \n\n- Set values for maximum and minimum order variables  \n- Set value for price variable\n- Get order_amount input and cast to a number  \n- Check order_amount and give message checking against  \n  - over maximum\n  - under minimum\n- Else within maximum and minimum give message with calculated price \n\n\nSample input and output:\n```\nEnter cheese order weight (numeric value): 113\n113.0 is more than currently available stock\n```\n\n```\nEnter cheese order weight (numeric value): .15\n0.15 is below minimum order amount\n```  \n\n```\nEnter cheese order weight (numeric value): 2\n2.0 costs $15.98\n```  "
